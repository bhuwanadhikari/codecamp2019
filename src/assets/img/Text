Hello Sir/Madam,
First of all, I ,on behalf my team would like to apologize that we were
unknown about the CodeCamp2019 and became very late for the proposal
submission.
We came to know about the event just this morning and we asked our friends
there to talk with your representatives if its still possible to apply for
the Code Camp.One of the representatives replied saying please send the
proposal and we will look into it.So,I am sending the proposal of our idea '
*GhumnaJaam*' on the theme '*Rural Tourism'.*

Please do find the attached proposal.
Once again,I apologize for delay and hope for your positive response.
Thank you!!

With best regards,
